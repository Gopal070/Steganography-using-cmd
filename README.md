### Practical:  Steganography using cmd
### Definition:

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data (like text, files, or images) inside another file — such as an image, audio, or video — so that no one can tell there’s hidden information.
Unlike encryption, which scrambles data, steganography hides its very existence.
Performing Steganography in Windows (Using CMD)
Here’s how you can hide and extract files using the Command Prompt (CMD) — without any external tools.
1. Prerequisites
•	You need:
o	A cover image file (example: cover.jpg)
o	A secret file you want to hide (example: secret.txt)
•	Place both files in the same folder (say, Desktop or Downloads).
##
Step 1. Create a folder on your desktop screen.

<img width="894" height="1100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0453825-f4ad-4945-a919-06db6c19d24e" />

 
Step 2. Put an  image inside that folder.

Step 3. Then open that folder.

Step 4. Then right click on screen.

Step 5. Then select “ Open in Terminal”.

Step 6. Type ls (it shows total items in  that folder and actual name).

Step 7. Then type  “ echo Your message>> file name”.

 <img width="975" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e8dcd45-a769-42c1-a3f3-e5245a7e970a" />

Step 8. Press enter.

Step 9. Then return to your folder and open that image with Notepad.

Now you can see your message that you have typed

<img width="975" height="415" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c29c8b-0014-43a5-bff7-b01d7e8e60fc" />
